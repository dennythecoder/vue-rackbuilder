# vue-rackbuilder

Vue Rackbuilder is a small sample page for showing functionality with a military ribbon rack.  The actual rack presented may or may not be in the appropriate order.  If you would like to fix anything, please consider adding a pull request or creating an issue with what is specifically wrong and the specific example you are referencing.

[Check out the demo](https://dennythecoder.github.io/vue-rackbuilder/home.html)

This page was made with IE in mind and without a build process.

# Interested in contributing?

Some pull requests that I will accept

- [ ] Separate app out into components.  The table is not important, but the rack and ribbons can be separated. 
- [ ] Adding order data for different services
- [ ] Add build process - rollup.js, babel.js, hotload dev server

# Just wanna copy a couple of things?

Have at it.
